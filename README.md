# Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks

## Description

- I used MNIST as train data.

- Mainly, learning process is same as Reguler GAN. But LSGAN, uses Least Squares criterion.

- In the Paper, the recommended values of a, b, c = -1, 1, 0 or 0, 1, 1

## result

- Generated images after trained LSGANs model 30 epochs
